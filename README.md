# LIZA
This is a simple chatbot that can answer the questions.

I`m use [nltk](https://github.com/nltk/nltk). python library.
It was build thanks to this tutorials: 
* I get my Tkinter page from [here](https://github.com/KeithGalli/GUI).
* Some bot answers from [here](https://github.com/randerson112358/Python/tree/master/ChatBot).


###### To do list:
* Clean up the code (It can look much better)
* Add more languages that bot can understand (I thought about adding Japanese, Russian, Ukrainian and maybe Spanish)
* PYQT version (but I'm not quite sure about this)


I have some ideas so maybe will create more advanced bots later.
